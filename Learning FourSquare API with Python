## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn in details how to make calls to the Foursquare API for different purposes. You will learn how to construct a URL to send a request to the API to search for a specific type of venues, to explore a particular venue, to explore a Foursquare user, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location. Also, you will learn how to use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.
